            The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly
            infectious
            coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
            (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in
            December
            2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a
            pandemic
            considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.

            the Indian Medical Association (IMA). He received the Dr BC Roy Award in 2005 and the Padma Shri in 2010.

            Over the past year, Dr Aggarwal’s popularity grew as he frequently posted videos on social media platforms
            in
            which he answered Covid-related queries and held talks about various aspects of the disease and its
            management. </p>

        <h2>Dr. ADIL EL TAYER </h2>
        <p>Surgeon and organ transplant specialist. He was born on March 10, 1956, in Atbara, Sudan, and died on March
            25, 2020, in London, UK, aged 64 years.
            As a young doctor working in Sudan, Adil El Tayar became aware of the rising problem of kidney diseases,
            particularly among young people. Without access to transplant surgery, patients were dependent on regular
            dialysis, which disrupted their ability to work or study. His mission was to replace the country's largely
            privatised, fragmented transplant services with a centralised registry and practice.

        <h2>Dr. SHIRIN ROUHANI</h2>
        <p>The Iranian doctor, Shirin Rouhani [Fig. 6], also lost her life while treating coronavirus patients. Her
            determination and will power was such that she continued to treat patients till her last breath even when
            she herself was on IV. She knew she could not rest because of the shortage of doctors and medical workers to
            cater to the needs of patients.</p>

        <h2>Final Words</h2>
        <p>While the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe,
            doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us. They are also risking the
            lives of their family members, which indeed is a huge sacrifice. On top of that, the shortage of face masks,
            shields, and protective gear is not helping. And this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more
            extraordinary. On occasion of the Doctors' Day (March 30, 2020 USA and Australia), the stories of the
            medical heroes putting themselves on the forefront to fight the virus are inspiring and heartbreaking at the
            same time. They deserve all the appreciation and support.  </p>
