            The 2019â€“2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious
            coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
            (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December
            2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic
            considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.
